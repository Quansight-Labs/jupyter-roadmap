# Quansight Jupyter roadmap

## :thinking: What is this repo about?

This meta-repository is meant to help us organize ourselves across the many organizations, projects, and use-cases and involvement in the Jupyter ecosystem. If you've got an idea for how this can be improved, please reach out!

**We sail together**
While we value each others individual strengths and contributions, we succeed or fail as a team. Whether taking corrective actions for a bug or being recognized for good work, the team, instead of an individual, shoulders the burden and success.

## :construction_worker_woman: Planning and operations

Currently, the Quansight Jupyter workforce is keeping tack of the goings-on in the community via the following main channels:

- Community calls
- Issues / PRs in Jupyter repositories 
- Jupyter Discourse
- Internal monthly Jupyter workshop
